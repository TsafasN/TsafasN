# Hi, I'm Nikolaos Tsafas

**Embedded Software Engineer** based in Athens 🇬🇷, passionate about **DevOps automation**, **bare-metal embedded systems**, and making things tick down to the last clock cycle.

My main areas of interest include low-level programming, bare-metal embedded systems, driver development, and real-time systems. I also have a strong focus on **requirements elicitation**, including the analysis of functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, **process models**, and **impact assessments**.

On the methodology side, I aim to improve developer productivity by crafting better tooling, writing clear and concise documentation, performing thoughtful refactorings, and designing developer-friendly workflows. I consider reproducible, maintainable, and easy-to-use build systems and test setups to be critical foundations for effective and sustainable development.

Commited to sound engineering practices and software processes.
